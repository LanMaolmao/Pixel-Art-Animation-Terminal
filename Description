### Im interested in making short animation in Linux terminal or pseudo terminal. 
I need to have control on the tempo and dynamics, 
it should be easily procedurally generated with initial seed, a
llowing to have control on some other parameters as geografic area,
or type of character avaliable. 
For example Pacific Eagle fighting storm in Japanese sea,
so it should go like Japanese scroll painting but allowing
custom 3 colors palete and shadowing, 
all available for terminal with video procedurally generated
in pixel art style separately but embedded in the game as video cuts ###
