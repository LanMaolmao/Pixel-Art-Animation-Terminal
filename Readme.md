### Im interested in making short animation in Linux terminal or pseudo terminal. 
I need to have control on the tempo and dynamics, 
it should be easily procedurally generated with initial seed, a
llowing to have control on some other parameters as geografic area,
or type of character avaliable. 
For example Pacific Eagle fighting storm in Japanese sea,
so it should go like Japanese scroll painting but allowing
custom 3 colors palete and shadowing, 
all available for terminal with video procedurally generated
in pixel art style separately but embedded in the game as video cuts ###

Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed:

Python: A versatile language for scripting and procedural generation.
Pillow: A Python Imaging Library for pixel art manipulation.
Ncurses: A library for creating text-based user interfaces in a terminal.
Ffmpeg: A tool to handle video encoding and processing.
Install them using the following commands:

bash
Copia codice
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip libncurses5-dev ffmpeg
pip3 install pillow

Step 2: Create Procedural Pixel Art
You'll need to create pixel art images that can be converted into ASCII or directly displayed as pixel art in the terminal. You can use Pillow for this:

python
Copia codice
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
import random

def generate_image(seed, width=80, height=24, palette=["#000000", "#FFFFFF", "#AAAAAA"]):
    random.seed(seed)
    img = Image.new('RGB', (width, height), color=palette[0])
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
    
    # Procedurally generate some shapes or patterns
    for _ in range(100):
        x1, y1 = random.randint(0, width), random.randint(0, height)
        x2, y2 = random.randint(0, width), random.randint(0, height)
        color = random.choice(palette)
        draw.line((x1, y1, x2, y2), fill=color)
    
    img.save('generated_image.png')
    return img

# Example usage
generate_image(seed=42)

Step 3: Convert Images to ASCII
To display images in the terminal, you might want to convert them into ASCII art:

python
Copia codice
def image_to_ascii(image, width=80):
    image = image.resize((width, image.height * width // image.width))
    image = image.convert('L')
    
    ascii_chars = "@%#*+=-:. "
    ascii_image = ""

    for y in range(image.height):
        for x in range(image.width):
            gray = image.getpixel((x, y))
            ascii_image += ascii_chars[gray * len(ascii_chars) // 256]
        ascii_image += '\n'
    
    return ascii_image

# Example usage
img = Image.open('generated_image.png')
ascii_art = image_to_ascii(img)
print(ascii_art)

Step 4: Animate the ASCII Art
Using Ncurses, you can create animations in the terminal:

python
Copia codice
import curses
import time

def animate_ascii(screen, frames, delay=0.1):
    curses.curs_set(0)  # Hide cursor
    screen.nodelay(True)
    
    for frame in frames:
        screen.clear()
        screen.addstr(frame)
        screen.refresh()
        time.sleep(delay)
        if screen.getch() != -1:  # Check for user input
            break

# Example usage
def main(stdscr):
    frames = [ascii_art]  # Load or generate multiple frames for animation
    animate_ascii(stdscr, frames)

curses.wrapper(main)

Step 5: Integrate Everything
You can combine procedural generation, ASCII conversion, and Ncurses animation to create your final animation:

Generate multiple frames with different seeds or parameters.
Convert each frame to ASCII.
Animate the frames using Ncurses.

Step 6: Customizing and Enhancing
Control Tempo and Dynamics: Adjust the delay in the animation loop and vary parameters during frame generation.
Geographic Area and Character Types: Customize the procedural generation logic to reflect different themes or settings.
Color Palette and Shadowing: Use the Pillow library to apply color palettes and effects before converting to ASCII.
